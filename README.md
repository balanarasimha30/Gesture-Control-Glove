## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a gesture-based human-computer interface using Arduino Leonardo, Flex Sensors, and ADXL345 Accelerometer.

The system converts hand gestures into keyboard inputs, enabling users to interact with a computer using natural hand movements instead of traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard.
